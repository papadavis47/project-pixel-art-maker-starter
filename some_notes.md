# Trying Something New Through Udacity

Thi is my Udacity PixelMaker web app project that I am currently doing for my Udacity front end web developer class. I am going to try various stuff to make it my own.

This will be the first file I am commiting to the GitHub repo that I forked from the Udacity instructors for this project.

This is my first file that I have created for the new branch. I can always delete it later. I am going to use this project as another way to work with GitHub as well. Learning about commits and branches and pull requests. As well as learning how to work with a repo on my local machine. I need practice with all of that stuff.
