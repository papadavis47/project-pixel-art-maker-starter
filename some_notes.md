#Trying Something New Through Udacity

Thi is my Udacity project PixelMaker web app that I am doing for my Udacity front end web developer class. I am going to try various stuff to make it my own.

This will be the first file I am commiting to the GitHub repo that I forked.
My first file on the new branch I created. I can always delete it later. I am going to use this project as another way to work with GitHub as well.
